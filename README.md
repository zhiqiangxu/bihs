# bihs, a bivalent variant for hotstuff protocol

**bihs** differs from hotstuff in two aspects:

1. the votes are splitted into `(height, view)` like pbft
2. the possible block for each height is bivalent, either the one proposed by current leader(which can be calculated after the confirmation of the previous block), or a deterministic empty block.

So **bihs** doesn't have the requirement to know leader for future block, it's as safe as pbft, while the complexity is still `O(n)`.

# Usage

```golang
var (
    store StateDB
    p2p P2P
    conf Config
)

# all you need to do is to provide the implementations for Block/StateDB/P2P interfaces

store = ...
p2p = ...

hs := New(store , p2p , conf)
hs.Start()

# after this, you can propose blocks when it's your turn

hs.Propose(someBlk)

# you can also wait for the confirmation of some block easily

hs.Wait(context.Background(), height)
```
